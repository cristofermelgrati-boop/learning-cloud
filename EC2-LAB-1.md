EC2 LAB 1 – Create and terminate an EC2 instance

1. I created a name for the instance. The name must be unique inside the account.
2. I selected an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), choosing Amazon Linux 2023 (Free Tier).
3. An AMI is the image that defines the operating system and base configuration of the instance.
4. I selected the instance type. In this case, I used t3.micro (Free Tier eligible).
5. I created a key pair to securely access the instance via SSH.
6. I configured a Security Group to allow SSH access only from my own IP address.
7. I launched the instance and verified that it was running correctly.
8. I stopped the instance to avoid unnecessary costs.
9. I terminated the instance, which permanently deletes it and prevents any further charges.
